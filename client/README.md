# Frontend client

- pnpm
- sveltekit


for development
`pnpm run dev`

# wallet - @privy-io
- uses twitter for the authentication
- `$lib/wallet/txHelpers.ts` is the main file for interacting with the chain
- privy initiated on `/dash` page and passed around via `walletStore` and `privyStore`
- working example: mintCitizen in `src/routes/dash/Modals/ModalRecruit.svelte`
    - use `$walletStore` from `/stores/wallet.svelte.ts` for `connection` and `address`

# fetching data - @tanstack/svelte-query
- api functions are in `src/lib/services/apiClient.ts`
    - use the `api` object which groups functions with keys
    - keys used in query for cache management
- queries are in `src/lib/services/queries.ts`
- to invalidate a query (refresh), use `$queryStore.invalidateQueries(queryKey)`
- example in `src/routes/dash/State.svelte`



# TODO PWA
- [x] add notifications (working but need to link it to something dynamic)
    - check `/` (landing page) to test the notifications. Open in chrome and install as PWA.
    - on mac, open Notifications & Focus, enable Chrome and Google Chrome Helper
- [ ] connect notifications to outside server

# TODO GENERAL
- [ ] balances
    - [x] add a "your total sol balance" (maybe where question mark is?)
    - [x] need a copy/paste of address
    - withdrawl sol
- [ ] replace ai news/tweets with real data (use `getNations()` tanstack example)
- [ ] inbox for bounties
    - bounties are where you can trigger PoW
    - empty placeholders are on `src/routes/dash/States.svelte` (under table)

- PoW need to add hashing
    - check this implementation: https://github.com/SPCG-NEST/sovereign/blob/develop-v2/circuits/tests/test01/test.ts
    - check out how to to do multithreading in mobile (in service worker)
    - bountyHashLimited > threshold = success
    - ```
        const bountyHash = poseidon4(inputs);
        const bountyHashLimited = reduceTo252Bits(numberToUint8Array(bountyHash));
