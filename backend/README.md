### Install
```bash
bun install
```

### Run
1. Start local validator. For example, from the `../programs` directory, run `bun run start`. 
2. In another terminal, start the ingestion engine from this directory with `bun run start`.

A quick test: from the `../programs` directory, run `bun test`. Program logs should print out to your second terminal.
